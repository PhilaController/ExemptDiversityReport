    <h2>Diversity of the Exempt Workforce</h2>
    <hr class="titlebar" />

    <p>
      The City’s exempt workforce totaled 4,723 employees at the end of FY21 and
      was 47.3% diverse, an increase from 45.8% in FY20. Since the Controller’s
      Office began analyzing diversity data in FY18, the City has incrementally
      increased its diverse representation among its exempt employees each
      fiscal year.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were dramatic improvements in the diverse representation of new
      hires in FY21 compared to prior years. In FY21, 63.3% of all new hires
      were diverse, a significant improvement from 53.7% in FY20 and more in
      line with the citywide population, which is 67.0% diverse. These
      improvements were also seen in executive new hires, which includes
      positions with salaries of at least $90,000.<footnote-reference /> Diverse
      representation in this group increased from 47.4% in FY20 to 58.7% in
      FY21. These changes occurred along with a year-over-year decline in
      overall hires (-181), the consequence of hiring freezes and increased
      attrition due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

      <h3>The Mayoral Administration</h3>
      <p>
        In 2017, Mayor Kenney’s administration created the Exempt Employee
        Hiring Guidelines<footnote-reference /> in an effort to increase diverse
        representation in the City’s exempt workforce. While the guidelines are
        not mandatory, Mayoral departments are expected to follow the
        recommendations for all exempt hires when possible. This section focuses
        only on the diversity of the workforce in these Mayoral departments,
        which included 1,690 exempt employees in FY21, and excludes exempt
        employees in independent offices.
      </p>

      <p>
        The figure below summarizes the changes in diversity for departments in
        the Mayoral administration for all exempts and exempts making at least
        $90,000. Similar to the overall exempt workforce, White employees
        accounted for 44.8% of the workforce in FY21, an improvement from 46.4%
        in FY20. Since FY18, Asian representation has increased from 5.2% in
        FY18 to 7.1% in FY21 and is nearly consistent with citywide demographics
        (7.5% Asian). Lastly, Hispanic representation was 8.4% in FY21, compared
        to 15.9% of the city’s population.

      <p>
        Diverse representation among new exempt hires in FY21 showed improvement
        over previous years, with representation among exempt employees falling
        in line with citywide demographics for the first time since FY18.
        Diverse groups made up 71.0% of new exempt hires in FY21 compared to
        67.0% of the citywide population, a significant improvement from FY20
        when diverse employees made up only 58.3% of new hires. Increased
        representation for Black and Hispanic new hires contributed to this
        increase: the share of Black new hires increased from 32.5% in FY20 to
        40.9% in FY21, and the share of Hispanic new hires increased from 8.3%
        in FY20 to 15.3% in FY21. Among diverse groups, Asian employees were the
        only group to experience a year over year decline in diversity among new
        hires, from 14.2% in FY20 to 10.2% in FY21.
      </p>

      <p>
        Diversity among new exempt hires for executive positions also
        significantly improved in FY21. The White share of these employees fell
        from 60.0% in FY20 to 43.8% in FY21, and the representation of Black
        employees among new executive hires increased from 20.0% in FY20 to
        25.0% in FY21. Additionally, while the City did not hire any Hispanic
        employees for executive positions in FY20, Hispanic employees made up
        12.5% of new executive hires in FY21.

      <h3>Departments with the Largest Exempt Workforces</h3>

      <p>
        About 80% of the City’s exempt employees were concentrated in six City
        departments in FY21. Three of these departments fall under the Mayor’s
        authority: the Managing Director’s Office (MDO), the Office of
        Innovation and Technology (OIT), and the Law Department. The remaining
        three are independent offices: the First Judicial District (FJD), the
        District Attorney’s Office (DAO), and City Council. There were a number
        of notable observations across these departments, as described below.

            Diverse representation was strongest in MDO and City Council at

            of any department; 49.5% of these new hires were Black or African

            Relative to FY20, there was a substantial improvement in the diverse

            (51.7% to 81.3%), City Council (55.3% to 80.0%), Law (40.0% to

            OIT is the only department of these six that saw a significant
            decline in the diversity of new hires. It added 21 new employees in
            FY21, and 57.1% of these employees were from diverse groups, a
