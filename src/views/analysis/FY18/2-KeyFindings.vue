      White employees are overrepresented in the exempt workforce relative to
      the city's overall population. Representation in exempt positions is
      lowest for Hispanic and Asian individuals. For departments under the
      Mayor's authority, 48.2% of the exempt workforce is White. For comparison,
      Philadelphia's population is 34.9% White and 65.1% non-White, according to
      2017 census data. Other than the Mayoral administration, the elected
      offices with the two largest exempt workforces, the First Judicial
      District and the District Attorney's Office, are 59.7% and 71.4% White,
      respectively.
