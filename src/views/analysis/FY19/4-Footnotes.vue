        Note that some departments disagreed with diversity data from the City’s
        payroll system. In these cases, the Controller’s Office reconciled any
        differences between the payroll data and department-provided data, if
        provided.

        Note that a number of new exempt employees are hired by the Law
        Department but paid through other departments. For example, the Law
        Department was responsible for paying for 23 new exempt hires in FY19
        (30% diverse), but the department hired 39 exempt employees, of which
        41% were diverse.
