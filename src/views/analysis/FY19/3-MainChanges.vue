      <h3>Overall Representation</h3>

      <p>
        In FY19, White employees were overrepresented in the exempt workforce
        relative to Philadelphia’s overall population, with the diversity of the
        workforce improving slightly from last year. Representation in exempt
        positions remained lowest for Hispanic and African American individuals.
        For departments under the Mayor's authority, 47.2% of the exempt
        workforce was White, a modest 1% decrease from FY18. For comparison,
        Philadelphia's population is 34% White and 66% diverse (Black or African
        American: 40.1%; Hispanic: 15.2%; Asian: 7.3%; Other: 3.1%), according
        to 2018 Census data.<footnote-reference /> Making up only 7.4% of the
        total exempt workforce, Hispanic employees in the Mayoral administration
        were the most underrepresented group relative to the overall city
        population, which is 15.2% Hispanic.
      </p>

      <p>
        As seen in the figure below, the workforce in Mayoral departments
        becomes substantially less diverse when considering exempt employees
        earning at least $90,000, with White employees making up 55.4% of
        workers in FY19. The diversity of this group has improved slightly from
        last year, increasing from 41.6% diverse in FY18 to 44.6% in FY19, but
        is still substantially below the city’s population (66% diverse). As in
        the overall workforce, Hispanic representation is lowest, with only 4.7%
        of exempt employees in this group identifying as Hispanic, well below
        the city’s 15.2% level.

    <!-- New Hires -->
    <div class="subsection new-hires">
      <h3>New Hires</h3>

      <p>
        In the Mayoral administration, White employees were also overrepresented
        among new hires in FY19, with 43% of new hires identifying as White,
        nearly the same level as FY18. While the overall diversity of new hires
        did not improve, there were some substantial changes among individual
        races and ethnicities. Black or African American representation declined
        from 38.2% in FY18 to 32.1% in FY19, while Hispanic representation among
        new employees increased from 7.1% to 10.5%. Asian representation among
        new hires remained similar to FY18 levels at 9.2%, while the share of
        new hires of all other races increased from 2.2% in 2018 to 5.5% in
        2019.
      </p>

      <p>
        New exempt hires earning more than $90,000 were substantially more
        diverse in FY19 compared to FY18. Black or African American individuals
        made up 46.8% of this group, the largest share among demographic groups
        and a notable increase from a share of 31.6% in FY18. Asian
        representation also increased, from 5.3% to 8.3%. On the other hand,
        Hispanic representation among these new hires decreased from 5.3% to
        4.3%, well below the city’s overall Census level. Just as in the overall
        workforce, Hispanic individuals were the most underrepresented group
        among new hires earning more than $90,000.

      <h3>Other Notable Changes</h3>

      <p>
        About 80% of the City’s exempt employees were concentrated in just six
        City departments in FY19. Three of these departments fall under the
        Mayor’s authority: the Managing Director’s Office (MDO), the Office of
        Innovation and Technology (OIT), and the Law Department. The remaining
        three are independently elected offices: the First Judicial District,
        the District Attorney, and City Council. As seen in the figure below,
        diverse populations were underrepresented in each of these department
        workforces in FY19.
      </p>

        loading="lazy"
      />

      <p>
        Diverse representation in the District Attorney’s Office improved
        slightly between FY18 and FY19 (28.6% to 31.2%), while diverse
        representation in the First Judicial District increased by less than one
        percentage point. Diverse employees were significantly underrepresented
        in the Law Department for the past two years, making up 34.2% of Law
        Department employees in FY19 while making up 66% of the city’s overall
        population.<footnote-reference /> Diverse representation increased
        modestly in the MDO and OIT between FY18 and FY19, with OIT having the
        largest share of diverse employees among the six largest exempt
        workforces at 58.3%. City Council has the second highest share of
        diverse employees at 57.5% in FY19, a modest increase from 55% in FY18.
      </p>

      <p>
        Four of the six largest exempt workforces saw increases in the shares of
        diverse employees making more than $90,000. The largest increases of
        diverse representation among high earners were in the MDO (+7.1
        percentage points) and OIT (+6.5 percentage points). The First Judicial
        District and District Attorney’s Office also increased their shares of
        diverse employees making more than $90,000; however, along with the Law
        Department, these departments have very small shares of diverse high
        earners, with diverse populations making up between 20.4% to 26.9% of
        high earners in these departments (vs. 66% of the city’s population).
      </p>

      <p>
        A few other smaller departments had notable changes in diverse
        representation among their employees. The Commerce Department’s exempt
        staff was made up of 67% diverse employees in FY19, meeting the Census
        threshold of diverse representation. In FY19, the Commerce Department
        had a net increase of 20 employees, 80% of which were diverse.
        Similarly, the Office of the Mayor had substantial diversity gains with
        a net increase of 16 exempt employees, 75% of which were diverse. On the
        other hand, the exempt workforces became less diverse from FY18 to FY19
        in Parks & Recreation (45.2% to 43.2%) and the Department of Human
        Services (52.6% to 49.0%). Of the six new exempt hires in Parks &
        Recreation, five were White.
