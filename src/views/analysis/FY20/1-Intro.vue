      The City of Philadelphia employs about 4,800 people that are not hired
      through the civil service system, known as exempt employees. The
      demographics of this exempt workforce are a direct reflection of the
      City’s hiring practices and can help evaluate the City’s ability to hire
      diverse candidates and maintain an inclusive work environment. The exempt
      workforce includes employees at all job levels, including those in senior
      leadership positions, such as department and cabinet heads.

      This review examines the racial breakdown of Philadelphia's exempt
      workforce at the end of fiscal year 2020 (FY20). It builds on previous
      reports by the Controller’s Office, which examined the demographics of the
      exempt workforce at the end of FY18 and FY19.<sup

      The data for this year’s review was compiled from the City’s OnePhilly
      payroll system, and departments were asked to verify its accuracy before
      finalizing. Similar to previous reports, exempt employees are shown in
      relation to the department from which they are paid.<sup

    <p>
      To evaluate the City's progress toward its diversity goals and the
      diversity of its leadership, the data is broken out into four important
      categories: all exempt employees, new exempt hires in FY20,<sup
        ><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">[3]</a>
      </sup>
      exempt employees with salaries of at least $90,000 (referred to as
      “executive” positions) and the subset of new hires with salaries of at
      least $90,000. The diversity of the City’s exempt workforce is examined
      separately for City departments that fall under the Mayor’s authority and
      for independent offices.
