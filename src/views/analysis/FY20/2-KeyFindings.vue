      <!-- Finding #1 -->
      <li>
        In FY20, diverse employees accounted for 45.8% of the exempt workforce
        and remain underrepresented relative to the city’s overall population,
        which is 65.7% diverse.
      </li>
      <!-- Finding #2 -->
      <li>
        For departments under the Mayor’s authority:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The exempt workforce was 53.6% diverse in FY20, about a one
            percentage point increase from last fiscal year.
          </li>
          <li>
            The increase in overall diversity was driven by an increase in Asian
            representation, with Asian employees accounting for 14.2% of new
            exempt hires in FY20, compared to 9.2% in FY19 and 9.4% in FY18.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since FY18, Asian representation has had the largest improvement,
            increasing from 5.2% in FY18 to 7.1% in FY20. On the other hand,
            African American representation has declined while Hispanic
            representation has remained nearly unchanged since FY18.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exempt workers in executive positions (earning at least $90,000) are
            less diverse than the overall workforce. Diverse representation in
            these positions decreased slightly from 44.6% in FY19 to 43.8% in
            FY20.
          </li>
          <li>
            White employees accounted for 60% (24 of 40) of new executive hires
            in FY20, compared to 40% in FY19 and 56% in FY18.
          </li>
          <li>
            Notably, there were no new Hispanic hires for executive positions in
            FY20.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <!-- Finding #3 -->
      <li>
        Diverse employees were also underrepresented in the independent offices
        with the two largest exempt workforces, the First Judicial District and
        the District Attorney's Office.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the First Judicial District, the exempt workforce was 40.9%
            diverse in FY20, a similar level as in previous years (41.0% in FY19
            and 40.3% in FY18).
          </li>
          <li>
            In the District Attorney’s Office, 35.7% of the exempt workforce was
            diverse in FY20, an underrepresentation compared to the city’s
            overall population, but a substantial improvement from FY19 (31.2%)
            and FY18 (28.6%).
