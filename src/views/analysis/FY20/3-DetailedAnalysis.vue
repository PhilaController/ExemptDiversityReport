    <h2>Diversity of the Exempt Workforce</h2>
    <hr class="titlebar" />

    <p>
      In FY20, the City’s exempt workforce, totaling 4,832 employees, was 45.8%
      diverse, an increase of less than one percentage point over the previous
      fiscal year. As seen in the figure below, White employees were
      overrepresented and accounted for 54.2% of the total workforce, well above
      the 34.3% share of Philadelphia’s population according to 2020 Census
      data.<footnote-reference /> Diverse representation decreases when focusing
      only on exempt positions with salaries of at least $90,000. For these
      executive positions, White employees accounted for 59.8% of the total, an
      increase of one percentage point from FY19 to FY20.

    <div class="subsection" id="mayoral-admin">
      <h3>The Mayoral Administration</h3>
      <p>
        In 2017, Mayor Kenney’s administration created the Exempt Employee
        Hiring Guidelines<footnote-reference /> in an effort to increase diverse
        representation in the City’s exempt workforce. While the guidelines are
        not mandatory, Mayoral departments are expected to follow the
        recommendations for all exempt hires when possible. This section focuses
        only on the diversity of the workforce in these Mayoral departments,
        which included 1,687 exempt employees in FY20, and excludes exempt
        employees in independent offices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similar to the citywide exempt workforce, White employees in Mayoral
        departments were overrepresented in FY20, accounting for 46.4% of the
        workforce. This represents a modest improvement from prior years, 47.2%
        in FY19 and 48.2% in FY18. Representation among diverse employees
        remained lowest for Hispanic and Asian groups, with Hispanic individuals
        making up 14.9% of the city’s population but only 7.4% of the Mayoral
        exempt workforce, and Asian individuals making up 8.3% of the city’s
        population but only 7.1% of the workforce.
      </p>

      <p>
        The figure below summarizes the changes in diversity for departments in
        the Mayoral administration. Since FY18, Asian representation has had the
        largest improvement, increasing from 5.2% in FY18 to 7.1% in FY20. On
        the other hand, African American representation has declined while
        Hispanic representation has remained nearly unchanged since FY18.
        Hispanic employees continue to be the most underrepresented group in the
        exempt workforce, both for Mayoral departments and independent offices.
      </p>

      <p>
        The right panel of the figure highlights that the exempt workforce in
        Mayoral departments becomes substantially less diverse when considering
        exempt employees earning at least $90,000 — White employees made up
        56.2% of these positions in FY20. The diversity of this group fell
        slightly from last year, decreasing from 44.6% to 43.8% diverse in FY20;
        however, this representation is an improvement compared to 41.6% in
        FY18. As with the overall workforce, Hispanic representation is lowest
        among employees earning at least $90,000, accounting for only 4.8% of
        exempt employees in this group.
      </p>

      />

      <p>
        When focusing on new exempt hires in FY20, White employees were also
        overrepresented, accounting for 41.7% of hires. The percent of diverse
        new hires increased from 56.8% in FY19 to 58.3% in FY20, a small
        year-over-year increase in diversity. This improvement was driven by
        Asian representation among new hires, which increased from 9.2% in FY19
        to 14.2% in FY20. African American representation stayed at about the
        same level in FY20 as FY19 at 32.5%, though this reflects a decline from
        38.2% in FY18. Hispanic representation in new hires also declined, from
        10.0% in FY19 to 8.3% in FY20.
      </p>

      <p>
        New exempt hires for executive positions were significantly less diverse
        in FY20 compared to FY19, with White employees accounting for 60.0% of
        new executive hires. The only notable improvement in diversity among new
        executive hires was a substantial increase in Asian representation,
        having more than doubled from 8.5% in FY19 to 20.0% in FY20.
        Representation across other diverse groups for these positions took a
        disappointing turn in FY20, with no new Hispanic executive hires, and
        with African American representation falling from 46.8% in FY19 to only
        20.0% in FY20.

      />

      <p>
        To better examine diversity trends for new hires, the City Controller’s
        Office requested additional information from departments with
        particularly low diverse representation among new hires in
        FY20.<footnote-reference /> Given that diversity statistics can vary
        from year to year, we selected five departments to evaluate the
        effectiveness of the City’s hiring process. These departments (the FJD,
        DAO, MDO, the Law Department and Public Health) hired at least 20 new
        employees with the exception of Public Health, which hired only seven
        employees, six of whom were White. For each new hire in these
        departments, the Controller’s Office asked a series of questions about
        the hiring process and adherence to the Exempt Employee Hiring
        Guidelines. Except for the FJD, each of these departments responded that
        they followed the Hiring Guidelines for new exempt hires in FY20. The
        FJD, which is an independent office and is not subject to the
        recommended policies in the guidelines, instead outlined their diversity
        initiatives, which include a recently hired Diversity, Equity, and
        Inclusion Chief and the creation of a unit to focus specifically on
        maintaining fair and diverse hiring practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collectively, these five departments hired 332 exempt employees in FY20,
        comprising 60% of all new exempt hires. White employees accounted for
        55.1% of the total and were substantially overrepresented relative to
        the city population, which is only 34.3% White. Despite this lack of
        diversity in new hires, the departments stated that they followed the
        recommended hiring policies from the Exempt Hiring Guidelines. This
        warrants a more detailed examination of the hiring process for exempt
        employees. This examination should seek to identify the root causes
        leading to the continued lack of diversity among new exempt hires and
        result in the implementation of necessary changes to ensure the City can
        attract and hire diverse candidates for its exempt workforce.

    <!-- Largest Departments-->
    <div class="subsection" id="largest-departments">
      <h3>Departments with the Largest Exempt Workforces</h3>

      <p>
        About 80% of the City’s exempt employees were concentrated in just six
        City departments in FY20. Three of these departments fall under the
        Mayor’s authority: MDO, OIT, and the Law Department. The remaining three
        are independent offices: the FJD, DAO, and City Council. As seen in the
        figure below, diverse individuals were underrepresented in each of these
        department workforces in FY20.
      </p>
      <p>
        Diverse representation in the DAO has improved each year since FY18,
        increasing from 28.6% in FY18 to 35.7% in FY20. Following the
        implementation of a number of steps intended to improve diversity,
        diverse representation among new hires in the DAO has improved
        substantially, increasing from just 34.0% in FY18 to 49.1% in FY20.
        Diverse representation in the FJD (40.9%) remained essentially unchanged
        year over year, having decreased by only one-tenth of a percentage
        point. Of the six largest departments considered here, the Law
        Department is the least diverse, with diverse employees accounting for
        only 34.6% of the department’s workforce. The overall increase in Asian
        representation in the City’s workforce was driven primarily by new hires
        in OIT, with 15 of 59 (25.4%) new hires identifying as Asian. OIT has
        the largest share of diverse employees among the six largest exempt
        workforces at 57.8%. City Council has the second highest share of
        diverse employees at 56.8% in FY20, a slight decrease from 57.5% in
        FY19.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of the six largest exempt workforces, only the FJD saw an increase in
        the share of diverse employees making at least $90,000. The increase was
        quite small, increasing by only one percentage point from FY19 to FY20.
        City Council had the largest decrease in representation among workers
        making at least $90,000 at -8.7 percentage points, followed by the MDO
        (-4.9 percentage points), OIT (-2.1 percentage points), Law (-0.7
        percentage points), and the District Attorney’s Office (-0.5 percentage
        points).

    <!-- Other Notable Changes -->
    <div class="subsection" id="other-changes">
      <h3>Other Notable Changes</h3>

      <p>
        A few other smaller departments had notable changes in diverse
        representation among their employees. The Office of the Chief
        Administrative Officer dramatically improved its diverse representation
        from 56.5% in FY19 to 67.3% in FY20, meeting the Census threshold for
        diverse representation. The Department of Homeless Services already had
        diverse representation meeting the Census threshold in FY19 but
        increased its share of diverse employees from 66.7% to 75.8%. On the
        other hand, Planning and Development, which has 25 exempt employees,
        slightly improved its diverse representation compared to FY19 but
        remained one of the least diverse departments in FY20 with only 36.0%
        diversity. Additionally, the exempt workforce became less diverse in the
        Department of Public Health (-8.6 percentage points), the Water
        Department (-6.7 percentage points), the Department of Public Property
        (-4.4 percentage points), and the Fire department (-3.8 percentage
        points).
