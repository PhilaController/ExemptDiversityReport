      <h3>Overall Representation</h3>

      <p>
        In FY20, the City’s exempt workforce, totaling 4,851 employees, was
        45.8% diverse. The diversity of the workforce increased by less than one
        percentage point over the previous fiscal year and remained far below
        the 65.7% diverse share of Philadelphia’s population according to 2020
        Census data.<sup>
          <a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="ref3">[3]</a>
        </sup>
        Representation among diverse employees in the exempt workforce remained
        lowest for Hispanic and Asian groups, with Hispanic individuals making
        up 14.9% of the city’s population but only 6.1% of the City’s exempt
        workforce, and Asian individuals making up 8.3% of the city’s population
        but only 4.3% of the total exempt workforce. African Americans were also
        underrepresented in FY20, making up 38.3% of the population but 33.5% of
        the exempt workforce. White employees, however, were overrepresented in
        the exempt workforce relative to Philadelphia’s overall population.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similar to the overall exempt workforce, White employees in departments
        under the Mayor’s authority were also overrepresented, accounting for
        46.4% of the workforce. This represents a modest improvement from prior
        years, 47.2% in FY19 and 48.2% in FY18. The figure on the following page
        summarizes the changes in diversity for departments in the Mayoral
        administration. Since FY18, Asian representation has had the largest
        improvement, increasing from 5.2% in FY18 to 7.1% in FY20. Hispanic
        representation has remained unchanged, and this group continues to be
        the most underrepresented minority in the Mayoral administration.
        Hispanic employees made up only 7.3% of the administration’s workforce
        in FY20, compared to 14.9% of the city’s overall population.
      </p>

      <p>
        The right panel of the following figure highlights that the exempt
        workforce in Mayoral departments becomes substantially less diverse when
        considering exempt employees earning at least $90,000 — White employees
        made up 56.0% of these positions in FY20. The diversity of this group
        fell slightly from last year, decreasing from 44.6% to 44.0% diverse in
        FY20; however, this representation is an improvement compared to 41.6%
        in FY18. As in the overall workforce, Hispanic representation is lowest,
        with only 4.7% of exempt employees in this group, well below the city’s
        14.9% level.

      <h3>New Hires</h3>

      <p>
        In the Mayoral administration, White employees were also overrepresented
        among new hires in FY20 with 41.7% of new hires identifying as White, a
        slight decrease from FY19. The overall diversity of new hires improved
        slightly, from 56.8% in FY19 to 58.3% in FY20. This improvement was
        driven by Asian representation among new hires, which increased from
        9.2% in FY19 to 14.2% in FY20. Black or African American representation
        stayed at about the same level in FY20 as FY19 at 32.5%, though this
        reflects a decline from 38.2% in FY18. Hispanic representation in new
        hires also declined, from 10.0% in FY19 to 8.3% in FY20.
      </p>

      <p>
        New exempt hires for executive positions were significantly less diverse
        in FY20 compared to FY19, with White employees accounting for 60.0% of
        executive new hires. The only notable improvement in diversity among new
        executive hires was a substantial increase in Asian representation,
        having more than doubled from 8.5% in FY19 to 20.0% in FY20.
        Representation across other diverse groups for these positions took a
        disappointing turn in FY20, with no new Hispanic executive hires, and
        with Black or African American representation falling from 46.8% in FY19
        to only 20.0% in FY20.

      <p>
        To better examine diversity trends for new hires, the City Controller’s
        Office requested additional information from eight departments with
        particularly low diverse representation among new hires in FY20. These
        departments were the First Judicial District, the District Attorney’s
        Office, the Managing Director’s Office (MDO), the Law Department, the
        Department of Public Health, Parks and Recreation, Commerce, and the
        Office of Innovation and Technology (OIT). For each new hire in these
        departments, the Controller’s Office asked a series of questions about
        the hiring process and adherence to the Exempt Employee Hiring
        Guidelines.<sup>
          <a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="ref4">[4]</a>
        </sup>
        Nearly all departments responded that they follow the Hiring Guidelines,
        from the initial phone screening to the final interview process with a
        diverse hiring panel. The First Judicial District, which is an
        independent office and is not required to following the guidelines, did
        not directly respond to the questions but instead summarized their
        hiring process and commitment to diversity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nearly all the departments that responded to questions had majority
        White (50% or more) new hires in FY20. The exceptions were OIT and MDO,
        which had 62.7% and 51.7% diverse representation among new hires,
        respectively. Collectively, the eight departments hired 398 exempt
        employees in FY20, with White employees accounting for 52.3% of the
        total. This lack of diversity raises clear questions regarding the
        effectiveness of the Hiring Guidelines in attracting diverse candidates
        and increasing diverse representation in the City’s workforce.

      <h3>Diversity in the Largest Exempt Departments</h3>

      <p>
        About 80% of the City’s exempt employees were concentrated in just six
        City departments in FY20. Three of these departments fall under the
        Mayor’s authority: the Managing Director’s Office (MDO), the Office of
        Innovation and Technology (OIT), and the Law Department. The remaining
        three are independently elected offices: the First Judicial District,
        the District Attorney, and City Council. As seen in the figure below,
        diverse individuals were underrepresented in each of these department
        workforces in FY20.
      </p>
      <p>
        Diverse representation in the District Attorney’s Office has improved
        each year since FY18, increasing from 28.6% in FY18 to 35.7% in FY20.
        Diverse representation in the First Judicial District (40.9%) remained
        essentially unchanged year over year, having decreased by only one-tenth
        of a percentage point. Of the largest departments, the Law Department is
        the least diverse, with diverse employees accounting for only 34.6% of
        the department’s workforce. The overall increase in Asian representation
        in the City’s workforce was driven primarily by new hires in OIT, with
        15 of 59 (25.4%) new hires identifying as Asian. OIT has the largest
        share of diverse employees among the six largest exempt workforces at
        57.8%. City Council has the second highest share of diverse employees at
        56.8% in FY20, a slight decrease from 57.5% in FY19.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of the six largest exempt workforces, only the First Judicial District
        saw an increase in the share of diverse employees making more than
        $90,000. The increase was quite small, increasing by only one percentage
        point from FY19 to FY20. City Council had the largest decrease in
        representation among workers making more than $90,000 at -8.7 percentage
        points, followed by the MDO (-4.9 percentage points), OIT (-2.1
        percentage points), Law (-0.7 percentage points), and the District
        Attorney’s Office (-0.5 percentage points).

      <h3>Other Notable Changes</h3>

      <p>
        A few other smaller departments had notable changes in diverse
        representation among their employees. The Office of the Chief
        Administrative Officer dramatically improved its diverse representation
        from 56.5% in FY19 to 67.3% in FY20, meeting the Census threshold for
        diverse representation. The Department of Homeless Services already had
        diverse representation meeting the Census threshold in FY19 but
        increased its share of diverse employees from 66.7% to 75.8%, including
        increasing its share of Asian employees by 9 percentage points. On the
        other hand, Planning and Development, which has 25 exempt employees,
        slightly improved its diverse representation compared to FY19 but
        remained one of the least diverse departments in FY20 with only 36.0%
        diversity. Additionally, the exempt workforce became less diverse in the
        Department of Public Health (-8.6 percentage points), the Water
        Department (-6.7 percentage points), the Department of Public Property
        (-4.4 percentage points), and the Fire department (-3.8 percentage
        points). Of the six new hires in the Department of Public Health, five
        where White.
